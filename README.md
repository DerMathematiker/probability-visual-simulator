# ðŸŽ² Probability Visual Simulator

A Python desktop application that simulates and animates probability exercises involving urn models and random draws â€” ideal for students and educators.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Visual representation of tokens in an urn
- Animated random draws of 3 tokens
- Real-time detection of probability events like:
  - All numbers different
  - Sum of tokens equals a given number
- Theoretical vs simulated probability comparison
- Customizable exercise setup

## ðŸ–¼ Example Exercise

> An urn contains 8 tokens:  
> - 1 token labeled 0  
> - 5 tokens labeled 1  
> - 2 tokens labeled 2  
>
> Whatâ€™s the probability that three randomly drawn tokens all have different values?
